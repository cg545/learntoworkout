        This website contains information about different exercises, the muscles they work, and the equipment required to perform them. It's meant to serve as a starting point for those just starting to exercise and as a knowledge base for those with more experience who are looking to try something new. It can be sorted using the buttons on the left, and users can contribute information using the "submit" button on the navigation bar. <strong>However, user-submitted information will not be published to the live website until approved by an administrator.</strong>
